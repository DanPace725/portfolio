- Co-authored institutional whitepapers on AI ethics and academic integrity, translating empirical findings into actionable policy recommendations

## Computational Research Projects

**Structural Coherence Framework for Decision Analysis** (2023–Present)

*Research Question*: Can decision failures be predicted by analyzing the structural topology of information environments rather than choice content?

- Developed a computational framework for evaluating decision contexts across five structural dimensions: continuity (identity stability), differentiation (role clarity), contextual fit (situational appropriateness), accountability (causal transparency), and reflexivity (safe adjustability)
- Framework decomposed from first-principles analysis of recurring structural patterns across physical and cognitive domains
- Implemented as working applications demonstrating practical utility for personal decision-making, interface design, and cognitive tool development
- Testing shows consistent diagnostic scoring of decision stability across different user contexts independent of domain-specific content

**Relational Coherence Navigator (CoNav)** (2024–Present)

*Application*: Browser-based decision support tool implementing structural coherence framework

- Interactive web application providing real-time structural analysis of user-described decision environments
- LLM-based natural language processing for contextual assessment across five coherence dimensions
- Generates composite coherence scores (0-1 scale) with interpretive bands (fragmented, strained, mixed, stable, coherent)
- Provides non-directive recommendations based on structural patterns rather than normative judgments
- Designed specifically to support neurodivergent decision-making by scaffolding executive function without eroding autonomy

**Emergence Engine (E²) – Agent-Based Cognitive Simulation** (2023–Present)

*Research Question*: How do structural features of decision environments (resource distribution, information topology, feedback availability) predict agent decision stability independent of agent-specific parameters?

- Developed browser-based simulation in JavaScript modeling adaptive behavior across ~20 behavioral parameters in resource-constrained environments
- Implements Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) optimization with adaptive heuristics for evolving behavioral strategies
- Observed emergent differentiation of survival strategies (efficient "cultivator" vs. mobile "forager" archetypes) from identical starting conditions under different fitness objectives
- Demonstrated spontaneous phase transitions from independent to collective movement patterns under resource scarcity
- Investigating parallels between emergent system dynamics and human decision-making under cognitive load, particularly ADHD-related attention dynamics

**ACE (Adaptive Cognitive Enhancement) Application** (2024–Present)

*Application*: Gamified task-tracking system for executive function support

- Built using Next.js and Supabase, grounded in behavioral activation principles and ADHD/ASD-informed executive function research
- Incorporates variable reinforcement schedules, cognitive load reduction strategies, and modular task decomposition
- Adaptive reward system scales task value based on environmental difficulty using exponential moving average of completion times
- Interface design minimizes decision friction while preserving user agency and intrinsic motivation
- Implementing user-centered design methodology to evaluate usability and behavioral outcomes

**Mindi – AI-Driven Chatbot & Organizational Tool** (2024–Present)

*Application*: Conversational interface for knowledge management and episodic memory scaffolding

- Developed AI-driven interface reducing cognitive load in information organization and retrieval
- Designed to support episodic memory scaffolding and executive function challenges common in ADHD populations
- Implements natural language processing for context-aware information storage and retrieval
